# ReFrame
ReFrame is an AI-powered mental health companion built using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques.

Sometimes you don’t need advice — you just need to feel heard. ReFrame listens, learns, and helps you reframe your thoughts with compassion and science.

CBT-Based Conversations

SerenityAI uses CBT frameworks like cognitive distortion detection, Socratic questioning, and reframing techniques to guide responses that actually help users challenge negative thinking.

Personalized Memory

Through vector-based memory, SerenityAI remembers your past conversations — the issues you’ve discussed, the coping tools that helped, and your emotional progress over time.

 Emotion Detection & Escalation

It identifies emotional tones (e.g., sadness, anxiety, hopelessness) and detects distress signals.
If high-risk patterns appear, it gently provides mental health helpline resources for immediate support.

 Journaling & Gratitude Prompts

Daily prompts for gratitude, thought logs, and emotion reflection — encouraging positive cognitive patterns and consistency.
